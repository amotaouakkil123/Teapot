Hi!

Welcome to my Teapot Shadows repository. Here you will find a video displaying a teapot with
some yellowy cubes that are supposed to display shadowing techniques. The source code can be found
within the repository.
The Axis class is where you'll find the code to draw the axis.
The Camera class is where all the camera vectors and matrices are stored for the light and viewing
computations.
ArcBall is a class that implements the ArcBall method of moving a scene around with a mouse.

Due to the packages that you would have to install to make the build work, I have provided
a short video detailing all the light, shadows, and arc ball features of the project as well as the source code to show the behind the scenes of the project.

You can find the video through this link: https://youtu.be/TRrFa4zIkQI
